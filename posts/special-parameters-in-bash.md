There is a say no difference between `$@` and `$*` in Shell! What ?!!

Have you ever thought if there is no difference, why there are two of them? it could be one `$@` or `$*` , Do You Agree?

So Letâ€™s see What the difference is . Create a script and try it one by one

First One `$@` :

```bash
#! /bin/bash 

MAIN()
{
        echo "First Parameter is $1"
}

MAIN $@
```

Execute it like below and give the script some arguments:

```bash
$ ./Diff.sh "Jhon Smith" "Marry Ann" 
$ First Parameter is Jhon

```

Second One `$*` :

```bash
#! /bin/bash 

MAIN()
{
        echo "First Parameter is $1"
}

MAIN $*
```

The result will be :

```bash
$ ./Diff.sh "Jhon Smith" "Marry Ann" 
$ First Parameter is Jhon
```

Far Now There is no difference, maybe those people were right!

Let us go further and try them with double quotes `"$@"` :

```bash
#! /bin/bash 

MAIN()
{
        echo "First Parameter is $1"
}

MAIN "$@"
```

```bash
$ ./Diff.sh "Jhon Smith" "Marry Ann" 
$ First Parameter is Jhon Smith
```

The second one in double quotes `"$*"` :

```bash
#! /bin/bash 

MAIN()
{
        echo "First Parameter is $1"
}

MAIN "$*"
```

```bash
$ ./Diff.sh "Jhon Smith" "Marry Ann" 
$ First Parameter is Jhon Smith Marry Ann
```

So be careful when you use double quotes and tell those people there is a difference, explain to them shell is sensitive to double quotes.
